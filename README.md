## Developing

### Built With
> react 15.5.4
> material-ui 0.18.1
> jest 19.0.2
> axios 0.16.2
> redux 3.6.0
> styled-components 2.1.0

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### Deploying
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```
And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

### Versioning
We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

### Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

## API Reference

## Database
